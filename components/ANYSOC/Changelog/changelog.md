### General information

You can view compatibility for this release, along with important information and what works, and what doesn't at this link: https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/Status.md


### Release notes

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Important information

- ⚠️⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This version of the drivers needs to be paired with UEFI version greater or equal to 2211.16.** ⚠️⚠️
- ⚠️⚠️ **IMPORTANT: If you get a BSOD/Bugcheck "SOC_SUBSYSTEM_FAILURE" when upgrading, you will have to reinstall Windows** ⚠️⚠️

### Changelog

#### Surface Duo 1

- Addresses all known issues currently known with the Device crashing during sleep with a workaround built into the Power Engine Plugin driver.

- Call provisioning is work in progress, if calls do not work for you at the moment, you may need to provision the call functionality manually. (Same as on Lumia 950s: https://woa-project.github.io/LumiaWOA/guides/ican0/, value is not different between 950s and Duo either, so if you already have such value, you're good to go, this is temporary!)

__Improvements to CPU core clock frequency will come in an upcoming release__

#### Surface Duo 2

- Addresses an issue preventing first boot from working. (Disables UCSI USB stack for now)

- Call provisioning is work in progress, if calls do not work for you at the moment, you may need to provision the call functionality manually. (Same as on Lumia 950s: https://woa-project.github.io/LumiaWOA/guides/ican0/, value is not different between 950s and Duo either, so if you already have such value, you're good to go, this is temporary!)

### Sensor Calibration Provisioning (Mandatory)


In order to get most sensors currently working, some manual steps are required.
Please follow the steps described at https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/InstallWindows.md#temporary-copy-over-calibration-filesconfiguration-files-for-the-sensors


It may also be possible to provision it using data from the SFPD partition exposed in windows. This manual step will not be required in future releases.


### Known issues


- Automatic Orientation only works for the left panel, using the right panel orientation sensor
- USB Dongles that are not externally powered may not currently work
- USB C Billboard devices will not currently work
- External Display Stream support will not currently work
- Additional information provided by the posture sensor is currently not available for public consumption, this includes peek events.
- Digitizers will not react to the device being folded over
- Displays will not react to the device being folded over most of the time
- Physical device data is incorrect
- Digitizers aren't calibrated correctly


### Accessing Foldable Sensors from your applications


In order to currently access the sensor data given by the foldable sensors, you need to use the following apis:


- Windows.Devices.Sensors.HingeAngleSensor*
- Windows.Internal.Devices.Sensors.FlipSensor* (2)
- Windows.Internal.System.TwoPanelHingeFolioPostureDevice* (2)


(2): These apis require the use of an externally sourced winmd available from https://github.com/ADeltaX/InternalWinMD/blob/master/%23winmd/Windows.Internal.Devices.Sensors.winmd


In the future, further apis will be functional (specifically under the Windows.System.Preview namespace). Consider this an early "thing".


The following API may be used to determine if your app is used on a dual screen device: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.windowingenvironment.getdisplayregions?view=winrt-22621

The following API may be used to determine on which display region your app is currently being shown: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.getdisplayregions?view=winrt-22621

The following API may be used to move your application to the other display: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.requestmoverelativetodisplayregion?view=winrt-22621

THe following API may be used to move your application to a specific display: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.requestmovetodisplayregion?view=winrt-22621

The following API may be used for spanning purposes: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.requestsize?view=winrt-22621

The Windowing Environment for Windows Desktop editions (outside of tablet mode) is Overlapped. Tiled is used for Tablet Mode and Windows Core OS's ModernPC.

How to offline update an existing Windows Desktop installation

- Switch the device into mass storage.
- Take note of the drive letter the Windows partition is using, here we will assume it got mounted as I:

- Download [SurfaceDuo-Drivers-Full.zip] from https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Drivers/releases/latest
- Extract said zip file to a folder of your choice, we will assume here we extracted it to C:\UpdatedDrivers
- Download the DriverUpdater utility from https://github.com/WOA-Project/DriverUpdater/releases/latest
- Open a command prompt as administrator, where the driver utility got downloaded

- Execute the following command:
  
  DriverUpdater.exe -d C:\UpdatedDrivers\SurfaceDuo-Drivers-XXXX\definitions\Desktop\ARM64\Internal\epsilon.txt -r C:\UpdatedDrivers\SurfaceDuo-Drivers-XXXX\ -p I:\

- Reboot the device, the device will now begin PnP setup once again, and hopefully you will be back soon enough to your desktop
